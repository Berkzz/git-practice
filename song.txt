I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right

nice song
